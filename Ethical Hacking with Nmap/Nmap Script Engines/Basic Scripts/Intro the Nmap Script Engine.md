## Nmap Scripting Engine

### 1. What is Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)?

  -> The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a powerful feature of the Nmap network exploration and security auditing tool. The NSE allows users to write and run scripts to automate a wide variety of network-related tasks, such as vulnerability detection, service enumeration, and version detection.

  -> The NSE comes with a large library of pre-written scripts, but users can also write their own custom scripts using the Lua programming language. These scripts can be used to interact with network services, send and receive packets, and perform complex tasks like brute-force password cracking.

  -> The NSE is designed to be extensible, so users can create their own libraries of scripts and share them with others. Additionally, the NSE supports script categories, allowing users to easily find and run scripts that meet their specific needs.
